Built-In Types
Build-In types are types that are intrinsic to the language, such as Int, char, and double. A type is built-in if the
compiler recognizes it and knows what to do with it without a declaration being included in the source code or header.

class
A user-defined type that specifies how an object is to be represented, constructed, interfaced with, and deconstructed.

const

Constructor
A member function with the same name as the class that is called upon creating an object that requires designated parameters.

Destructor

enum
A simple user-defined type that specifies values for a series of symbolic constants.

Enumeration
A structure referred to as an enum that allows for a sequence of values to be given symbolic constants and types.
Enumerations come in both scoped and plain varieties. In general, modern code does not use plain enumerations due to 
possible scope mix-ups and surprises with unintended number comparisons.

Enumerator
The values in an enum body.

Helper Function

Implementation
The code of a class that is required for the class to successfully run but not essential to interacting with the class.

In-Class Initializer
When a class 

Inlining

Interface
Code for a class that is visible to public and determines how a class may be called by the rest of the program.

Invariant
The rule(s) for what consistutes a valid value and subsequently a valid state for an object.

Representation
Representation is when a type knows how to hold the data it is provided, i.e. how to represent the data we are giving it.

struct
A user defined type intended to only store data where all members are public by default.

Structure
The method by which data is organized in an object.

User-Defined Types
Types created by the user to store data per a user-specified structure. User defined types are intrisically composed
of built-in types.

Valid State
When an object has a value that is valid for the intents and usages of the objects. An object is in an invalid state if
the values contained are erroneous or otherwise invalid, for instance, a date of Febtober in the date class, or a negative
user age.
