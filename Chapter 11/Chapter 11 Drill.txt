01. Start a program called Test_Output.cpp. Declare an integer birth_year and assign it the year you were born.

02. Output your birth year in decimal, hex, and octal base.

07. Go back to 2 and cause your output to show the base for each output.

08. Try reading as octal, hex, etc, 
	cin >> a >> oct >> b >> hex >> c >> d;
	cout << a << '\t' << << b << '\t' << c << '\t' << d << '\n';

	Run this code with this unput: 1234 1234 1234 1234 and explain the results.

09.	Write some code to print the number 1234567.89 three times, first using default float, then fixed, then scientific.
	Which output form presents the most accurate output to the user? Explain why.
