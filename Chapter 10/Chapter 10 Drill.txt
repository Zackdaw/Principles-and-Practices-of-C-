01.	Start a program to work with points, discussed in 10.4. Begin by defining the data type Point that has two 
	coordinate members (x, y).

02.	Using the code and discussion in 10.4, prompt the user to input seven (x,y) pairs. As the data is entered,
	store it in a vector of Point(s) called original_points.

03.	Print the data in original_points to see what it looks like.

04.	Open an ofstream and output each point to a file named mydata.txt. On Windows, we suggest appending the 
	.txt suffix to the file to make it readable by NotePad.

05.	Close the ofstream and then open an ifstream for mydata.txt. Read the data from mydata.txt and store it 
	in a new vector called processed_points.

06.	Print the data elements from both vectors.

07.	Compare the two vectors and print "Something Went Wrong!" if the number of elements or values are 
	incongruent.
