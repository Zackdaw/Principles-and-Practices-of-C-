01.	What is the purpose of working on the program after the first version works? Give a list of reasons.

02. Why does 1+2; q typed into the calculator not quit after it recieves an error?

03.	Why did we choose to make a constant character called number?
	The use of a constant named number allows us to eliminate the magic number 8 and instead just use "number" in its 
	place.

04.	We split main() into two separate functions. What does the new fuction do and why did we split main()?

05.	Why do we split code into multiple functions? State principles.

06.	What is the purpose of commenting and and how should it be done?

07.	What does narrow_cast do?

08.	What is the use of symbolic constants?

09.	Why do we care about code layout?

10.	How do we handle %(remainder) of floating point numbers?

11.	What does is_declared() do and how does it work?

12.	The input representation for let is more than one character. How is it accepted as a single token in the modified code?

13.	What are the rules for what names can and cannot be in the calculator program?

14.	Why is it a good idea to build a program incrementally?

15. When do you start to test?

16.	Why do you retest?

17. How do you decide what should be a separate function?

18.	How do you choose names for variables and functions? List possible reasons.

19. Why do you add comments?

20. What should be in comments and what should not?

21. When do we consider a program finished?
