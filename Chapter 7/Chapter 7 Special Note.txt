Chapter 7 is a rather difficult one to do the structure that has been established for previous chapters due to the 
questions being for a different version of the calculator than the one that is now online. Due to this, the exercises
and drills are altered somewhat to take the most from the as possible but do not necessarily follow the book.

Changes are as follows:
	+	Rather than implementing partial solutions for the exercises that don't make sense in the context of the 
		new calculator version, the calculator was refactored into a more modular program.
	+	Several questions were poorly stated and I could not figure out exactly what was being asked. Therefore in these
		questions I have instead simply made the program more usable. In particular, exercises 5 - 11 are of 
		questionable value in terms of actually learning more about C++ rather than simply moving around existing 
		functions.
	+	A much larger emphasis was placed on creating a usable calculator that is modularly programmed and makes greater
		use of headers and constants to allow for a more easily maintainable program.

For this reason, Chapter 7 is a bit of a mess but is complete in the sense that it accurately completes the intention
of the chapter.
